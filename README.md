# Hashing
A Hashing algorithem. I made one in another project and just decided to put it here as well

Yeah I mean I will probably re visit this, but as an FYI I quickly copied the version in the other project into this one, so im assuming they run the same.
In terms of objectives, it hit what i wanted it to, which is
-For the whole output to change if any one of the inputs change
-For the output to be fixed (length)
-For each input to always map to the same output
-For it to be virutally unckrackable (Which I think it is)

So yeah proud of this one, But I will come back to this and make it better in the future
